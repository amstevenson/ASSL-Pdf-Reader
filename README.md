# Basic Android Template
A basic android template. 

This comes packaged with a local database that you can remodify (see https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/index.html ). Some simple tests have been written for the one that I setup for the purpose of making sure that it works. You can open the application and run the tests to ensure that it has been setup correctly.  

This template also comes with a basic screen that has some buttons included on it alongside a navigation drawer.
